# Contributing to OpenWeatherStation

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

Here are some important resources:

  * [STM32 Cube IDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) for Software Development
  * [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) for Electronic Design
  * Catia v5 r19 for CAD Design and Mechanical Integration
  
 
## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to OpenWeatherStation](https://github.com/VitalSeptfonds/OpenWeatherStation/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using four spaces (soft tabs)
  * We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around hash arrows.
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

Thanks,
Vital Septfonds
